# Data-Manifold-Convolution
Tools and demonstrations relating to data manifold convolution (DMC), a tool for computing the effective "overlap" between two collections of points. 

This repository contains matlab function files which implement different definitions of DMC. The input to any DMC function is two sets of vectors in spaces of equal dimensionality. The output is a single number, which will be higher for when the two sets have many points close to each other.
